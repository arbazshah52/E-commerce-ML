# E-commerce ML

Machine-learning project that predicts whether an e-commerce session will result in an order. It contains a backend prediction service, a Streamlit frontend, a reproducible training pipeline, Docker Compose configuration, and CI checks.

## Start the project

The easiest way to run the complete system is Docker Desktop with Docker Compose:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Open:

- API documentation: http://localhost:8000/docs
- API health: http://localhost:8000/health
- Streamlit frontend: http://localhost:8501

Stop the services with:

```bash
docker compose down
```

The frontend does not train or select a prediction model. It collects the seven session inputs, calls the backend, and displays the returned prediction and explanation. The backend owns model loading, feature handling, inference, and model metadata.

## Data and model

The event data contains `clicks`, `carts`, and `orders`. The model uses these seven features:

```text
num_clicks
num_carts
num_events
num_unique_items
session_duration_seconds
hour
weekday
```

For sessions containing an order, only clicks and carts before the first order are used. The checked-in model is currently an SVC with scaling. Its metadata and recorded test metrics are stored in `model/metadata.json`.

## Backend API

Run the backend locally from the repository root:

```bash
uv run uvicorn backend.api:app --reload --port 8000
```

### `GET /health`

Returns service and model status:

```json
{ "status": "ok", "model_loaded": true, "model_name": "SVC" }
```

### `GET /model-info`

Returns the checked-in model name, feature list, and recorded test metrics. The frontend uses this endpoint for its model-performance view.

### `POST /predict`

The request body contains session information:

```json
{
  "num_clicks": 10,
  "num_carts": 2,
  "num_events": 12,
  "num_unique_items": 8,
  "session_duration_seconds": 320.5,
  "hour": 18,
  "weekday": "Friday"
}
```

Example request:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/predict \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "num_clicks": 10,
    "num_carts": 2,
    "num_events": 12,
    "num_unique_items": 8,
    "session_duration_seconds": 320.5,
    "hour": 18,
    "weekday": "Friday"
  }'
```

The response includes the numeric prediction plus a risk level, reasons, a suggested company action, and a draft customer message. These are decision-support suggestions, not causal explanations or guarantees.

## Training

Run the reproducible training pipeline from the repository root:

```bash
uv run python -m backend.train
```

Training reads `data/events_10000_sessions.csv` and updates the artifacts under `model/`. The pipeline performs feature creation, chronological splitting, model comparison, final evaluation, and artifact saving.

## Tests

Run the complete test suite:

```bash
uv run python -m pytest -q
```

Compile the application packages:

```bash
uv run python -m compileall -q backend frontend
```

## CI and Docker

GitHub Actions installs dependencies, runs the tests, compiles both application packages, validates Docker Compose, and builds the image. Docker Compose runs:

- `backend.api:app` on port 8000
- `frontend/streamlit_app.py` on port 8501

The frontend receives `API_URL=http://api:8000` inside the Compose network.
